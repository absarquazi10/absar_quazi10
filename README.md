I’m a 12th-grade student at Maulana Azad College of Arts, Science and Commerce, deeply interested in Information Technology and how digital systems work behind the scenes. I enjoy exploring topics like computer networks, online safety, and problem-solving through technology. 
Outside academics, I’m passionate about football.
I’m constantly looking to learn new tech skills and understand how technology shapes our world.
