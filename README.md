# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Absar Quazi, a 12th-grade student with a strong passion for programming and technology. I love exploring how things work and enjoy turning ideas into real, functional projects through code. My curiosity drives me to learn new programming languages, experiment with tools, and continuously improve my problem-solving skills.<br><br>I’m particularly interested in how technology can be used to create meaningful solutions and make everyday life easier. I enjoy working on small projects that challenge my creativity and push me to think differently. For me, programming isn’t just a subject — it’s a way to express ideas and build things that matter.<br><br>Outside of coding, I’m deeply passionate about football. It’s a sport that has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance — qualities that I carry into my learning and projects.<br><br>I believe in constant growth, whether it’s improving my technical abilities or learning from others in the tech community. As I continue my journey, I’m excited to keep exploring, creating, and developing both as a programmer and as a person.
